PROJECT PROMPT — INTERACTIVE AI DRIVING SIMULATOR MODE

You are building an advanced interactive module inside a full-stack autonomous driving experimentation platform.

This module introduces a “Driving Simulator Mode” where users can manually drive vehicles, compete with AI cars, and receive AI-generated coaching and safety analysis.

The simulator must remain aligned with autonomous driving and AI experimentation concepts — not just entertainment.

---

1. CORE SIMULATOR OBJECTIVE

---

Create a 2D top-down driving simulation environment where:

* Users control a vehicle using keyboard input.
* Vehicles obey simplified real-world physics.
* AI-driven cars race or drive alongside the player.
* Driving telemetry is recorded.
* AI analyzes driving behavior and provides improvement recommendations.

The simulator acts as a hybrid between:

* Racing simulator
* Autonomous driving validation sandbox
* Human vs AI performance lab

---

2. USER DRIVING CONTROLS

---

Implement keyboard-based driving mechanics:

Movement:

* Arrow Up / W → Accelerate
* Arrow Down / S → Reverse / decelerate
* Arrow Left / A → Steer left
* Arrow Right / D → Steer right

Advanced controls:

* Space → Acceleration boost
* Shift → Brake
* Ctrl → Handbrake (optional)

Driving physics must support:

* Velocity
* Acceleration
* Friction
* Turning radius
* Braking distance
* Momentum

---

3. VEHICLE PHYSICS MODEL

---

Implement simplified but realistic 2D vehicle dynamics:

Core variables:

* velocity
* acceleration
* steering angle
* friction coefficient
* mass (optional)

Physics features:

* Gradual acceleration (no instant speed)
* Realistic braking distance
* Steering-based turning arcs
* Drift effect under low friction
* Collision response on impact

Weather must affect friction:

Sunny → high grip
Rain → reduced grip
Fog → moderate grip
Ice → very low grip

---

4. AI-DRIVEN VEHICLES

---

Implement AI-controlled cars using waypoint path-following.

AI capabilities:

* Lane following
* Speed adaptation
* Curve braking
* Overtaking logic
* Collision avoidance

Difficulty tiers:

Easy:

* Slow speed
* Early braking
* Minimal overtaking

Medium:

* Balanced driving
* Competitive racing

Hard:

* Aggressive overtakes
* Late braking
* High corner speed

---

5. GAME MODES

---

Implement multiple simulation modes:

Time Trial:

* Complete laps in shortest time.

Safety Mode:

* Avoid collisions and near misses.

AI Benchmark:

* Race against AI vehicles.

Endurance Mode:

* Long-distance survival driving.

Training Mode:

* Focus on skill improvement metrics.

---

6. TELEMETRY COLLECTION

---

Capture real-time driving data:

* Average speed
* Max speed
* Brake intensity
* Steering smoothness
* Reaction time
* Lane deviation
* Near misses
* Collisions
* Lap time

Store telemetry per session.

---

7. AI DRIVING COACH (OpenAI Integration)

---

After each run, send telemetry data to OpenAI API.

AI must generate:

* Driving improvement feedback
* Safety analysis
* Risk observations
* Performance coaching

Example output:

“You applied excessive braking before medium-speed corners, reducing lap efficiency. Earlier throttle modulation would improve stability.”

AI acts as:

* Driving coach
* Safety analyst
* Performance reviewer

---

8. MAP SYSTEM OVERVIEW

---

Implement 10 maps with increasing complexity and difficulty.

Each map must include:

* Unique layout
* Environmental hazards
* Traffic patterns
* Physics modifiers
* AI difficulty scaling
