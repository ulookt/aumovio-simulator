PROJECT MASTER PROMPT — FULL-STACK AI COMPUTE & SIMULATION PLATFORM (POSTGRES STACK)

You are helping me design and implement a full-stack web application for a technical internship interview.

The project must match the following mandatory stack and architectural expectations:

---

## MANDATORY TECHNOLOGY STACK

Backend:

* Python
* FastAPI (preferred) or Flask

Frontend:

* React (Single Page Application)
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* shadcn/ui component library
* Recharts for analytics visualizations

Database:

* PostgreSQL (MANDATORY — not SQLite)

Infrastructure:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

AI Integration:

* OpenAI / ChatGPT API

Nice-to-have concepts to reflect architecturally:

* CI/CD pipelines
* Kubernetes deployment readiness
* Compute orchestration
* Authentication & authorization

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

We are building:

“A synthetic autonomous driving experimentation platform that enables AI engineers to generate driving scenarios, execute simulation experiments on shared compute infrastructure, analyze training performance, evaluate safety risks, and receive AI-generated engineering insights.”

This is NOT a real autonomous driving system.

It is the internal platform used by AI product teams to run and evaluate experiments.

The system simulates:

* High-performance compute provisioning
* Large-scale dataset storage
* AI training workflows
* Safety validation analytics

---

## CORE PLATFORM MODULES

1. SCENARIO GENERATOR

---

Users create synthetic driving environments.

Input parameters:

* Weather (rain, fog, sunny)
* Time of day (day, night)
* Traffic density (slider)
* Road type (city, highway)
* Pedestrian frequency

Output:

Structured scenario dataset stored in PostgreSQL.

Schema example:

scenarios table:

* id (UUID)
* weather
* time_of_day
* traffic_density
* road_type
* object_count
* created_at

Purpose:

Simulates autonomous driving test environments.

---

2. 2D SCENE SIMULATION

---

A top-down visualization of the generated scenario.

This is NOT 3D simulation.

It is a lightweight perception playback environment.

Scene includes:

* Ego vehicle
* Traffic vehicles
* Pedestrians
* Obstacles
* Lanes & intersections

Movement:

* Waypoint-based animation
* Scripted obstacle avoidance
* Speed adjustments

Rendered in React using Canvas or SVG.

---

3. COMPUTE JOB ORCHESTRATION

---

Users launch AI simulation experiments.

Job configuration includes:

* Scenario ID
* Model type (mock)
* Epoch count
* Compute tier

Compute tiers simulate HPC infrastructure:

Example tiers:

Small:

* GPU: T4
* VRAM: 8GB
* Low cost

Medium:

* GPU: A100
* VRAM: 40GB

Large:

* GPU: H100
* VRAM: 80GB

jobs table (PostgreSQL):

* id
* scenario_id (FK)
* compute_tier
* epochs
* status
* progress
* runtime_sec
* cost_estimate
* created_at

Multiple jobs can run concurrently.

---

4. METRICS & ANALYTICS SYSTEM

---

Training metrics are synthetically generated.

metrics table:

* id
* job_id (FK)
* epoch
* loss
* accuracy
* detection_score

Compute telemetry table:

compute_metrics:

* id
* job_id (FK)
* gpu_utilization
* vram_usage
* cpu_usage
* runtime_sec

Visualizations (React + Recharts):

* Loss vs Epoch line chart
* Accuracy curve
* GPU utilization graph
* Cost vs performance bars

---

5. SAFETY RISK ANALYSIS

---

Derived from scenario + performance metrics.

risk_analysis table:

* id
* job_id (FK)
* collision_probability
* pedestrian_risk
* visibility_risk
* safety_score

Displayed as:

* Risk gauges
* Heatmaps
* Hazard indicators

Purpose:

Connect AI performance → road safety.

---

6. STORAGE PLATFORM SIMULATION

---

To simulate large-scale storage infrastructure, the system tracks:

* Scenario dataset size
* Artifact storage
* Logs
* Reports

artifacts table:

* id
* job_id
* artifact_type
* file_size_mb
* created_at

Dashboards show:

* Storage utilization
* Dataset growth
* Artifact distribution

---

7. CHATGPT API INTEGRATION

---

Generative AI enhances the platform.

Use cases:

A) Scenario Intelligence
Explains risk factors in generated environment.

B) Experiment Insights
Analyzes training metrics.

C) Safety Explanation
Interprets collision risk.

D) Compute Optimization
Suggests better resource allocation.

Backend sends structured experiment data → ChatGPT → stores insights.

insights table:

* id
* job_id
* insight_text
* created_at

---

8. JOB RUNTIME MODEL

---

Simulation runtime must feel realistic but demo-friendly.

Runtime targets:

* 10–30 seconds per job

Runtime depends on:

* Scenario complexity
* Traffic density
* Compute tier

Worker loop generates metrics gradually.

---

9. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

---

React SPA (Frontend)
↓
FastAPI Backend
↓
PostgreSQL Database

OpenAI API (Insight Engine)

All services containerized via Docker Compose.

---

10. DOCKER ARCHITECTURE

---

Services:

* frontend (React)
* backend (FastAPI)
* postgres (DB)
* worker (job simulator)

Each has its own Dockerfile.

---

11. UX / VISUAL DESIGN GOALS

---

Platform should resemble enterprise AI dashboards:

* Dark theme
* Metric cards
* Animated charts
* Risk heatmaps
* Status badges
* Job tables

---

12. VALUE PROPOSITION

---

The platform demonstrates:

* AI-assisted engineering insights

---

13. CONSTRAINTS
